The user must answer every question in order to progress in the application. Next, the user will be prompted with adding employees. The user will have a choice of adding an engineer or an intern. Each employee type has their own set of questions. Engineer questions will ask about employee name, ID, email, and Github username. Intern questions will ask about their name, ID, email, and what school they are from. At the end of their questions, the user will be asked if they would like to add another member/employee. When the user is done adding team members, they will put "N" when asked about adding another member. Lastly, The application will generate the html and css in the dist folder.
